# rs-bookmark-tool

Use this to quickly write a bunch of bookmarks in the TOML format I've specified at [this project](https://github.com/deeptronos/edu-bookmarks).

Use [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) to check validity of URLs in TOML outputs.

## TODO:

- Link this project's `/toml` directory to `edu-bookmarks` project?
